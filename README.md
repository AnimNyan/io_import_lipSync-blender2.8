# io_import_lipSync-blender2.8
io_import_lipSync_Importer.py for Blender 2.8

This plugin is not made by me but was updated to support Blender 2.8

IMPORTENT READ BEFORE USE.
The plugin has only been tested with Pappagayo ".dat" files and only with the use of shape keys, the Pappagayo software used was Pappagayo-NG 1.4.2 https://github.com/morevnaproject/papagayo-ng . When importing lipsync files uncheck the Relative Path box, found on the bottom left side of the file browser.
